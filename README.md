This React app serves as a reading list for users. Here’s how it works:

1) Adding a New Book:

Users can add a new book by filling out a form displayed at the bottom of the screen.
After typing in the book title, they click “Submit.”
The app processes the input, clears the form, and adds a new card with the entered book title.

2) Managing the Reading List:

Once users have assembled their reading list, they can edit or delete books.
To delete a book, users click the “X” icon at the top right corner of the book card.
To change a book’s title, users click the pencil icon.
Clicking the pencil toggles “edit mode” for that individual book.
3) In edit mode:

The card displays a text input field with the current book title.
Users can modify the title.
After making changes, they click “Save.”
Edit mode is then disabled, and the card reflects the updated title.

That’s the essence of the app! It provides a straightforward way for users to manage their reading lists.
